map = userId's and dealer identities
while(NrOfConnectedClients != 610):  #just 3 for the beginning
	recv
	save client to map


lst = movies that similar users watched
while(true):
	recv msg
	if msg == recommend:
		check neighbours from knn_graph
		send requests to corresponding users (using map)
		recv user profiles
		recommend movie--> send to the user

	if msg.startsWith(myMovies):
		add them to lst
		


can I assume that other clients will wait to request movie recommendations until all clients connect?
OR: the below way
OR: signaling between threads

do I need new thread/socket for each new connected client? (poller?)
(zmq contexts are thread safe but not sockets)

OR:
while(True):
	recv
	if new user:
		save user to the UserId-SocketId_Map

	else if recommendation request:
		check neighbours from knn_graph
		send requests to similar users
		wait until all similar users are connected
		after receiving all needed user profiles:
			process & send the movies to the user

	else if user profile reply:
		add them to user-movie_Map

s_sendmore(socket, string) is string data or the id of the dealer?
